            <h3>Common Misconceptions YOU May Have!?</h3>
            <h5>
              You might believe green energy is unreliable and expensive, but...
            </h5>
            <ul>
              <li>
                modern grids use storage, forecasting, and diverse energy
                sources to provide reliability.
              </li>
              <li>
                prices for wind, solar, and storage have dropped dramatically.
              </li>
              <li>
                clean energy is now often cheaper than fossil fuels over the
                full lifecycle.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h5>
              You might think solar only works in sunny, hot climates; and don't
              work at all in winter, but...
            </h5>
            <ul>
              <li>
                solar panels work on cloudy or cool days and often perform
                better in lower temperatures.
              </li>
              <li>
                snow may slow output temporarily, but it isn't something to
                worry about in the long term.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h5>
              You believe solar installation is too expensive for most people,
              however...
            </h5>
            <ul>
              <li>
                costs to create solar panels have declined up to 90% in the past
                15 years.
              </li>
              <li>
                cost per Watt for installation is down to below £2.50 per Watt,
                though overall installation is still costly in total, most make
                back what they paid in a decade or so.
              </li>
              <li>
                the price of manufacturing is expected to drop by 25-35% in the
                next 5 years.

            <h3>Awesome Solar Energy Facts You Might Not Know</h3>
            <h5>
              Did you know solar energy is now the cheapest source of
              electricity?
            </h5>
            <p>
              In many places, it costs less to produce solar power than to run
              existing coal plants.
            </p>
            <h5>
              Switching to solar can reduce an average home's electricity bill
              by over 50% annually.
            </h5>
            <h5>
              Your roof gets more solar energy in a year than your whole home's
              electricity usage!
            </h5>
            <p>
              Even in cloudy regions, a properly sized solar system can cover
              most or all of a household's electricity needs.
            </p>
            <h5>
              A single house's solar panels can offset as much carbon in the
              atmosphere as planting over 100 trees!
            </h5>
            <h5>
              Did you know solar panels usually pay for themselves in after 6-10
              years?
            </h5>
            <p>After that, all electricity is essentially free!</p>
            <h5>
              Alongside this, houses with solar panels installed will sell for
              more!
            </h5>
            <p>
              You won't need to look after them once they're installed, only
              minor cleaning and maintenance is needed
            </p>
            <h5>
              Solar panels are scalable, versatile and energy independent.
            </h5>
            <p>
              You won't need to rely on the grid as much, and solar is silent as
              opposed to other generators which make plenty of noise
            </p>
